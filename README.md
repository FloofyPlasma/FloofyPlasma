### Hiya
---

I'm FloofyPlasma. I have experience with Luau, TypeScript, and various dialects of C. I especially like Objective-C. I enjoy modularizing and refactoring code,
and try to contribute to open source projects that I find interesting.

### Current Projects
---

#### [aabric](https://github.com/FloofyPlasma/aabric-example-mod)

A Babric backport for Minecraft Alpha 1.1.2_01. It's still a little unstable right now, but usable.

#### [Raccoon](https://github.com/FloofyPlasma/raccoon)

A statically-typed, systems programming language with manual memory management, and a focus on simplicity. Uses [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) as a backend.
