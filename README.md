### Hiya
---

I'm FloofyPlasma. I have experience with Luau, TypeScript, and various dialects of C. I especially like Objective-C. I enjoy modularizing and refactoring code,
and try to contribute to open source projects that I find interesting.

### Current Projects
---

#### [BlockheadsServer](https://github.com/FloofyPlasma/bh-server)

A decompilation of the server binary for [Blockheads](https://theblockheads.net/).
Written in Objective-C++, and uses [libobjc2](https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2) for cross-platform support.

#### [aabric](https://github.com/FloofyPlasma/aabric-example-mod)

A Babric backport for Minecraft Alpha 1.1.2_01. It's still a little unstable right now, but usable.
It's currently not supported on the Modrinth site because not enough mods use it. 

#### [Raccoon Script](https://github.com/FloofyPlasma/raccoonscript)

A programming language that uses [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) as a backend.
Why did I make this? I got bored. Yup. I got bored. Thats all the justication for this monstrocity of a project.
